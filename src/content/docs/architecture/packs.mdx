# Packs

Packs are the unit of distribution in Greentic. They are signed, versioned bundles that contain everything needed to deploy a digital worker.

## What's in a Pack?

A pack (`.gtpack` file) contains:

- **Flows** — YGTC files defining the worker's behaviour
- **Component References** — Manifests for required components
- **Configuration Schemas** — Validation for runtime config
- **Metadata** — Version, author, signatures, dependencies

```
my-worker.gtpack
├── manifest.json
├── flows/
│   ├── main.ygtc
│   └── ingestion.ygtc
├── components/
│   ├── llm-openai.manifest.json
│   └── adaptive-card.manifest.json
├── schemas/
│   └── config.schema.json
└── signatures/
    └── manifest.sig
```

## Pack Manifest

The `manifest.json` describes the pack:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://greentic-ai.github.io/greentic-pack/schemas/v1/pack.manifest.schema.json",
  "name": "it-support-worker",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "IT support assistant with LLM classification",
  "author": {
    "name": "Greentic Team",
    "email": "team@greentic.ai"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "flows": [
    {
      "id": "it-support",
      "file": "flows/main.ygtc",
      "type": "messaging",
      "entrypoint": true
    }
  ],
  "components": [
    "component.llm-openai@0.1.0",
    "component.adaptive-card@0.1.0",
    "component.qa-process@0.1.0"
  ],
  "config_schema": "schemas/config.schema.json"
}
```

## Building Packs

### From a Single Flow

```bash
greentic-dev pack build -f my-flow.ygtc -o dist/my-worker.gtpack
```

### From a Directory

```bash
greentic-dev pack build -d ./my-project -o dist/my-worker.gtpack
```

### With Custom Manifest

```bash
greentic-dev pack build --manifest pack.manifest.json -o dist/my-worker.gtpack
```

## Signing Packs

All packs should be signed for integrity and authenticity:

```bash
# Generate a signing key
greentic-dev keys generate --output ~/.greentic/signing-key.pem

# Build and sign
greentic-dev pack build -f my-flow.ygtc -o dist/my-worker.gtpack --sign ~/.greentic/signing-key.pem
```

### Verifying Signatures

```bash
greentic-dev pack verify dist/my-worker.gtpack --key public-key.pem
```

## Deploying Packs

### Local Testing

```bash
greentic-dev pack run -p dist/my-worker.gtpack --mocks on
```

### To a Runner

```bash
greentic-dev pack deploy -p dist/my-worker.gtpack --runner https://runner.example.com
```

### Through the Distributor

```bash
greentic-dev pack publish -p dist/my-worker.gtpack --store https://store.greentic.ai
```

## Versioning

Packs follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** — Breaking changes to flows or config
- **Minor** — New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** — Bug fixes, no API changes

```bash
# Bump version
greentic-dev pack version patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
greentic-dev pack version minor  # 1.0.1 -> 1.1.0
greentic-dev pack version major  # 1.1.0 -> 2.0.0
```

## Dependencies

Packs can depend on specific component versions:

```json
{
  "components": [
    "component.llm-openai@^0.1.0",
    "component.adaptive-card@~0.1.2"
  ]
}
```

Version specifiers:
- `1.0.0` — Exact version
- `^1.0.0` — Compatible with 1.x.x
- `~1.0.0` — Compatible with 1.0.x
- `>=1.0.0` — At least version 1.0.0

## Configuration

Runtime configuration is validated against the pack's schema:

```json
// schemas/config.schema.json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "llm_model": {
      "type": "string",
      "default": "gpt-4o"
    },
    "max_retries": {
      "type": "integer",
      "default": 3
    }
  }
}
```

Deploy with configuration:

```bash
greentic-dev pack deploy -p my-worker.gtpack --config production.json
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Packs Focused

One pack, one purpose. Don't bundle unrelated flows.

### Version Everything

Always include version in the manifest. Enable rollbacks.

### Sign All Production Packs

Never deploy unsigned packs to production.

### Document Configuration

Include clear descriptions in your config schema.

### Test Before Publishing

Run local tests before publishing to the store:

```bash
greentic-dev pack test -p my-worker.gtpack
```
