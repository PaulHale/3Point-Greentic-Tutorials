# Introduction to Greentic

Greentic is a **modular, multi-tenant automation platform** built around WebAssembly components. It enables you to build digital workers that can execute complex tasks autonomously across multiple channels and integrations.

## What is a Digital Worker?

A digital worker is an intelligent automation that can:

- **Receive messages** from various channels (Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.)
- **Process information** using LLMs, scripts, and business logic
- **Execute actions** through MCP tools and external APIs
- **Respond appropriately** with text, rich cards, or triggered workflows

Unlike traditional chatbots or automation scripts, digital workers in Greentic are:

- **Secure** — WebAssembly sandboxing ensures components can't access what they shouldn't
- **Portable** — The same worker runs on any cloud, edge, or on-premises
- **Observable** — Full OpenTelemetry integration for traces, metrics, and logs
- **Composable** — Build complex behaviours from simple, reusable components

## Core Concepts

Greentic is built around three fundamental concepts:

### Components

Components are self-describing WebAssembly modules that execute specific logic. Each component:

- Runs in a secure sandbox with strict capability controls
- Declares its configuration schema for validation
- Exposes a standard `handle(request) -> response` interface
- Can be versioned, signed, and distributed

Examples include LLM integrations, Adaptive Card builders, script engines, and more.

```yaml
# Example component reference in a flow
component.llm-openai:
  config:
    model: gpt-4o
    temperature: 0.7
```

### Flows

Flows are declarative YAML files (`.ygtc`) that wire components together. They define:

- **Nodes** — Named steps that invoke components
- **Routing** — Conditions that determine the next node
- **State** — Data passed between nodes
- **Triggers** — How the flow is activated

```yaml
# Example flow structure
id: support-flow
type: messaging
start: collect-info

nodes:
  collect-info:
    component.qa-process:
      config:
        questions:
          - What's your issue?
    routing:
      next: classify

  classify:
    component.llm-openai:
      config:
        system: Classify this IT support request
    routing:
      next: respond
```

### Packs

Packs are signed, versioned bundles that contain:

- One or more flows
- Required component manifests
- Configuration schemas
- Deployment metadata

Packs are the unit of distribution through the Greentic supply chain, ensuring that workers are auditable, reproducible, and secure.
