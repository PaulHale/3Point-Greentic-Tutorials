# Quickstart

In this guide, you'll create a simple digital worker that echoes back messages. This introduces the core concepts without overwhelming complexity.

## Create a New Flow

First, create a directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-first-worker
cd my-first-worker
```

Create a flow file called `echo.ygtc`:

```yaml
# echo.ygtc
id: echo-flow
type: messaging
description: A simple echo bot that repeats what you say
start: echo

nodes:
  echo:
    component.template:
      config:
        template: "You said: {{in.text}}"
    routing:
      next: __end__
```

## Validate the Flow

Before running, validate your flow to catch any errors:

```bash
greentic flow validate echo.ygtc
```

You should see:

```
✓ Flow 'echo-flow' is valid
  Type: messaging
  Nodes: 1
  Start: echo
```

## Run Locally

Start the flow:

```bash
greentic run
```

This starts an interactive console where you can test your flow:

```
Greentic Dev Server
Flow: echo-flow
Type: messaging

> Hello, world!
You said: Hello, world!

> Testing 123
You said: Testing 123
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

## Add More Complexity

Let's make it more interesting. Update your flow to greet the user by name:

```yaml
# echo.ygtc
id: echo-flow
type: messaging
description: A greeting bot that asks for your name
start: ask-name

nodes:
  ask-name:
    component.template:
      config:
        template: "Hello! What's your name?"
    routing:
      next: greet

  greet:
    component.template:
      config:
        template: "Nice to meet you, {{in.text}}! How can I help you today?"
    routing:
      next: echo

  echo:
    component.template:
      config:
        template: "You asked: {{in.text}}"
    routing:
      next: echo
```

Run again to see the multi-step conversation:

```bash
greentic run
```

```
> (conversation starts)
Hello! What's your name?

> Claude
Nice to meet you, Claude! How can I help you today?

> What's the weather like?
You asked: What's the weather like?
```

## Build a Pack

When you're ready to distribute your worker, build it into a pack:

```bash
greentic pack build --in . --gtpack-out dist/echo.gtpack
```

This creates a signed, versioned bundle that can be deployed anywhere.

## What's Next?

You've just built your first digital worker! Here's where to go from here:

### Learn the Architecture

- **[Components](/docs/architecture/components)** — Understand the Wasm component model
- **[Flows](/docs/architecture/flows)** — Deep dive into YGTC flow syntax
- **[Packs](/docs/architecture/packs)** — Learn about distribution and deployment

### Build Something Real

- **[Tutorial 1: Hello World](/tutorials/demo-1-hello-world)** — Extended version of this quickstart
- **[Tutorial 2: IT Support Bot](/tutorials/demo-2-it-support)** — Add LLM intelligence
- **[Tutorial 3: RAG System](/tutorials/demo-3-rag-system)** — Full-stack knowledge base

### Connect to Channels

- **[Messaging Overview](/docs/messaging/overview)** — Connect to Teams, Slack, etc.
- **[WebChat](/docs/messaging/webchat)** — Embed chat in your website

## Key Takeaways

1. **Flows are YAML** — Declarative, readable, version-controlled
2. **Nodes invoke components** — Each node runs a specific piece of logic
3. **Routing connects nodes** — Simple flow from one step to the next
4. **Packs bundle everything** — Ready for secure distribution
