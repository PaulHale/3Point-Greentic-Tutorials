# Installation

This guide walks you through installing Greentic and its dependencies on your development machine.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Greentic, ensure you have:

- **Rust** — Version 1.85 or later ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- **Node.js** — Version 20 or later (for WebChat development)
- **Docker** — For running local services (optional)

### Install Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Add the Wasm Target

Greentic components compile to WebAssembly. Add the required target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

## Install the CLI

Install Greentic via Cargo:

```bash
cargo install greentic
```

### Initialize Your Environment

Run the init command to set up your environment:

```bash
greentic init
```

This command:
- Creates configuration directories (~/.greentic/)
- Registers your user account
- Generates a `GREENTIC_TOKEN` for accessing the Greentic store

### Verify Installation

```bash
greentic --version
```

## Configuration

The `greentic init` command creates a default configuration at `~/.greentic/config.toml`. You can customize it as needed:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = true
endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"

[secrets]
provider = "env"

[runtime]
log_level = "info"
```

## Optional: Set Up Local Services

For full local development, you may want to run supporting services:

### OpenTelemetry Collector

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name otel-collector \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest
```

### Redis (for State)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name redis \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  redis:latest
```

## Verify Your Setup

Run the verification command to check everything is working:

```bash
greentic doctor
```

You should see output like:

```
Checking Greentic environment...

✓ Rust toolchain: 1.85.0
✓ Wasm target: wasm32-wasip2
✓ greentic: installed
✓ Config file: ~/.greentic/config.toml
✓ GREENTIC_TOKEN: configured

All checks passed! Ready to build digital workers.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Wasm Target Not Found

If you see errors about the Wasm target, ensure it's installed:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

### Permission Denied

On macOS/Linux, you may need to adjust permissions:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.cargo/bin/greentic
```

### Config File Issues

Ensure your config file has valid TOML syntax. Run the doctor command to validate:

```bash
greentic doctor
```

## Next Steps

With Greentic installed, you're ready to build your first digital worker:
